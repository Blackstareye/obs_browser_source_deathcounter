# Death Counter for OBS Browser Source

This is a simple Death Counter using REST-API (nodejs) and the OBS Browser Source.
The REST-API can then be triggered via Nightbot see [Nightbot Commands](#nightbot_commands)

It has three parts:

- Backend (NodeJs)
- Frontend (Window that will be integrated in OBS)
- [Nightbot](https://nightbot.tv) Commands

Demo (with Controls): <https://spring-chlorinated-seahorse.glitch.me>

created by Blackeye / Blackstareye

## Getting started

1. clone or remix the repo
   * if you have a glitch.com account, you can remix it via this [link](https://glitch.com/~hip-holly-beak)
   * clone the repo to your server. The server must run node js!
2. edit data.json file for setting the sound file (if needed)
2. go to OBS and add a Browsersource with the url of your server
3. if you have nightbot, insert the commands [below](#nightbot_commands)
4. Have fun

optional: restrict the commands for mods only if needed

## Features

- increase death count
- decrease death count
- reset death count
- set death count to a specific value

### Enabling Controls 

Uncomment the Block (Line 52) on index.html  to get Buttons like it is used on the DEMO.


## Note for Glitch Users

1. the first nightbot command (request) can be a bit slow ! Glitch sets the container without requests on sleep mode, hence they need to wake up first.

## Nightbot Commands

Nightbot Commands, change '<your_domain_url>' to the url of your deathcount server

```sh
!commands add !death+ $(eval const result=$(urlfetch json <your_domain_url>/inc); result["msg"])
!commands add !death- $(eval const result=$(urlfetch json <your_domain_url>/dec); result["msg"])
!commands add !deathreset $(eval const result=$(urlfetch json <your_domain_url>/reset); result["msg"])
!commands add !deathset $(eval const result=$(urlfetch json <your_domain_url>/set?n=$(1)); result["msg"])
```

!death+ : increase
!death- : decrease
!deathreset: reset
!deathset _number_ : set death counter to _number_
